# GLOVE demos

GLOVE is accompanied by a demo SDK that contains fully commented, highly optimized C applications (accompanied by the ESSL shader source code). These demos demonstrate some simple rendering techniques with different geometry complexities, as they were designed with the restrictions of low-power embedded platforms in mind (see **Table 1** ).

| **Name** | **Dimension** | **Shading Functionality** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| triangle2d\_one\_color | _2D_ | _Draw a single 2D triangle with_ **white color**|
| triangle2d\_split\_colors | _2D_ | _A 2D triangle is rendered on the screen. The color of each non-empty pixel is dynamically chosen at runtime between_ **2 fixed colors** _(red &amp; green) based on its screen-space position._ |
| circle2d\_sdf | _2D_ | _A dynamically generated circle is drawn (with time-varying radius) using_ **signed distance fields**. _Note that no geometry (for the 2D circle) is streamed to hardware._|
| texture2d\_color | _2D_ | _A **fullscreen quad rendering** (using two triangles) is used to draw a 2D texture._|
| cube3d\_vertexcolors | _3D_ | _Draw a 3D rotated (in Y axis) cube in the center of the screen with **per-vertex colors**. Note that this example also supports_ **transparency** _via blending operations and_ **orthographic** _camera projection (default: perspective)._ |
| cube3d\_textures | _3D_ | _Similar graphics rendering framework as &#39;_ **cube3d\_vertexcolors** _&#39; but with different shading method:_ **Mixing two textures.** |
| render\_to\_texture\_filter\_gamma | _2D/3D_ | _2D image processing effects on a texture generated by off-screen rendering a 3D rotated cube (using demo example_ **&#39;cube3d\_texture** _&#39;). To achieve this, we initially render scene to a Frame Buffer Object (FBO) and then perform post-processing_ **Gamma correction** _filtering on the generated texture._ |
| render\_to\_texture\_filter\_invert | _2D/3D_ | _Similar graphics rendering framework as &#39;_ **render\_to\_texture\_filter\_gamma** _&#39; but with different filtering effect:_ **Color Invert** |
| render\_to\_texture\_filter\_grayscale | _2D/3D_ | _Similar graphics rendering framework as &#39;_ **render\_to\_texture\_filter\_gamma** _&#39; but with different filtering effect:_ **Grayscale** |
| render\_to\_texture\_filter\_sobel | _2D/3D_ | _Similar graphics rendering framework as &#39;_ **render\_to\_texture\_filter\_gamma** _&#39; but with different filtering effect:_ **Sobel** |
| render\_to\_texture\_filter\_boxblur | _2D/3D_ | _Similar graphics rendering framework as &#39;_ **render\_to\_texture\_filter\_gamma** _&#39; but with different filtering effect:_ **Box Blur** |

**Table 1.** Example demos name and description

## Execution

Open a new terminal and navigate to the &#39; **build/Demos/demos**&#39; directory (``` $ cd build/Demos/demos/ ```), then run all examples by typing this command:

```
$ ./run_all_samples.sh
```

Note that file logging of OpenGL debug and Vulkan profile is supported (use **--help** for details).

## Configuration

A number of object-like and conditional macros have been used to offer debug and profiling features as well as to simplify the setting process of the demo configuration (see **Table 2** ).

| **Name** | **Values** | **Functionality** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DEBUG** |(a)DEBUG\_OPENGLES (b)DEBUG\_ASSET\_MANAGEMENT | _Enable to log errors for (a) OpenGL ES API and (b) asset management respectively._ |
| **PROFILE** | (a)FPS\_DISPLAY, FPS\_TIME\_PERIOD = **X** (b)INFO\_DISPLAY | _Enable to report (a) processed time in fps and ms for the time period of_ **X** _seconds and (b) shading and rendering settings respectively._ |
| **CONFIG** | KILL\_APP = **Y** | _Enable to auto terminate the application after the time period of_ **Y** _seconds (suggestion: Y&gt;X)._ |
| **BINARY\_PROG** | DBINARY\_PROG | _Enable to load from a precompiled shader program. Disable to load from vertex and fragment shaders._ |
| **WINDOW\_SIZE** | WIDTH = W, HEIGHT = H | _Set the dimensions of the application window to be_ **[W,H].** _Note that this macro definition is mandatory._ |

## Key Bindings

A list of key bindings are provided for information and testing purposes (see **Table 3** ). Note that the keys &#39;t&#39; and &#39;p&#39; are available only for the &#39;**cube3d\_vertexcolors**&#39; and &#39;**cube3d\_textures**&#39; demos that handles 3d shapes.

| **Key** | **Functionality** | **Mode** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Esc** | _Exit the application_ | _-_ |
| **t** | _Changes the material type of all objects_ | _Opaque/Transparent_ |
| **p** | _Changes the projection transformation of the camera_ | _Perspective/Orthographic_ |

# Offline Shader Compilation Tool

An offline compiler interface of input (vertex and fragment) shader sources is also provided ensuring that the resulting shader program binary can be efficiently loaded into the graphics application. This is a very useful path for applications that wish to remain portable by shipping pure ESSL source shaders, yet would like to avoid the cost of compiling their shaders at runtime. The tool, which can be found in the &#39; **build/Demos/tools**&#39; folder (``` $ cd build/Demos/tools/ ```), works by compiling and linking the given shaders and returns back the final program binary through a command-line interface. If the vertex and fragment ESSL source shader names are &#39;**sh.vert**&#39; and &#39;**sh.frag**&#39; respectively, then the generated precompiled binary shader program, named &#39;**sh.bin**&#39;, can be generated by executed this command:

```
$ ./offline_shader_compiler -v sh.vert -f sh.frag -o sh.bin
```

Note that, the **BINARY\_PROG** macro preprocessor in the &#39; **CMakeLists.txt**&#39; file has to be provided in the **CMAKE\_C\_FLAGS** to inform graphics applications to use precompiled shaders (see **Table 2**).
